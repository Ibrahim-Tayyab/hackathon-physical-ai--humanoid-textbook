# DEPLOYING NOW - Creating files directly...

Since the create tool requires the parent directory to exist, please:

1. Run this command in Windows CMD:
```cmd
mkdir "E:\Hackathon_AI\hackathon-youtube\physical-ai-textbook\docs\06-Appendices"
```

2. Then I can create all three files programmatically.

OR

You can manually create the directory and I'll generate all content for you to paste.
