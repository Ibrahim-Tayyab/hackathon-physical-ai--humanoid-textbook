# The Physical AI Workstation

## Why Hardware Matters

Unlike web development or data science, **Physical AI development is hardware-intensive**. You're not just training neural networks—you're simulating physics, rendering 3D environments, and running real-time robot controllers simultaneously.

The wrong hardware will turn this journey into a frustrating slog of slow simulations and out-of-memory crashes. The **right hardware** will make development feel like magic.

This chapter will guide you through building or configuring a workstation optimized for Physical AI development.

## The Golden Configuration

### 🎯 **Recommended Specifications**

| Component | Specification | Why It Matters |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **GPU** | NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM) | Isaac Sim requires 8GB+ VRAM; 12GB provides headroom for complex scenes |
| **CPU** | Intel i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 9 7900X | Physics simulations are CPU-bound; need 8+ cores |
| **RAM** | 32GB DDR4/DDR5 | ROS 2 + Gazebo + Isaac Sim can easily consume 20GB+ |
| **Storage** | 500GB NVMe SSD | Fast I/O for Docker images, simulation assets, and logs |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (native) | ROS 2 Humble officially supports Ubuntu 22.04; WSL2 has limitations |

**Estimated Cost:** $1,500 - $2,000 USD (as of 2024)

## Component Deep Dive

### 🎮 **GPU: The Heart of Physical AI**

#### Why NVIDIA RTX?

NVIDIA GPUs have **CUDA cores** required for:
- **Isaac Sim:** Built on Omniverse, requires CUDA for physics and rendering
- **PyTorch/TensorFlow:** Deep learning frameworks use CUDA for training
- **OptiX Ray Tracing:** Photorealistic sensor simulation (cameras, LiDAR)

:::warning AMD GPUs Not Supported
AMD Radeon GPUs (even high-end ones like RX 7900 XTX) **cannot run Isaac Sim**. ROCm support is limited and unstable for robotics workloads.
:::

#### Recommended Models

| GPU | VRAM | Price | Best For |
|-----|------|-------|----------|
| **RTX 4060 Ti** | 8GB | $400 | Budget option; single robot simulations |
| **RTX 4070 Ti** | 12GB | $600 | ⭐ **Sweet spot**; multiple robots, complex scenes |
| **RTX 4080** | 16GB | $1,000 | Large-scale simulations, reinforcement learning |
| **RTX 4090** | 24GB | $1,600 | Maximum performance; research labs |

:::tip Our Recommendation
The **RTX 4070 Ti** offers the best price-to-performance ratio. 12GB VRAM is sufficient for 95% of Physical AI workloads.
:::

#### What About Older GPUs?

| GPU | VRAM | Isaac Sim Support? |
|-----|------|---------------------|
| RTX 3060 Ti | 8GB | ✅ Works, but limited |
| RTX 3080 | 10GB | ✅ Good performance |
| RTX 2080 Ti | 11GB | ⚠️ Outdated, but functional |
| GTX 1080 Ti | 11GB | ❌ No ray tracing support |

**Minimum:** RTX 3060 or better
**Recommended:** RTX 4070 Ti or better

---

### 🧠 **CPU: The Physics Engine**

Physics simulations (Gazebo, Isaac Sim) are **CPU-bound** for:
- Collision detection
- Rigid body dynamics
- Constraint solving (joints, motors)

#### Why 8+ Cores Matter

Modern simulators parallelize physics across CPU cores:

```python
# Example: Gazebo simulating 10 robots simultaneously
# Each robot needs 1-2 CPU threads for physics calculations
# Total CPU usage: 10 robots × 2 threads = 20 threads
# On 8-core CPU (16 threads): Runs at 50-60 FPS
# On 4-core CPU (8 threads): Runs at 15-20 FPS ⚠️
```

#### Recommended CPUs

**Intel (13th/14th Gen):**
- Intel i7-13700K (16 cores, 24 threads) – $350
- Intel i9-13900K (24 cores, 32 threads) – $500

**AMD Ryzen (7000 Series):**
- AMD Ryzen 9 7900X (12 cores, 24 threads) – $400
- AMD Ryzen 9 7950X (16 cores, 32 threads) – $550

:::info Budget Option
If budget is tight, prioritize GPU over CPU. An RTX 4070 Ti + Ryzen 7 7700X (8-core) will outperform an RTX 4060 + Ryzen 9 7950X.
:::

### 💾 **RAM: The Multitasking Buffer**

Physical AI development involves running multiple heavy applications simultaneously:

```bash
# Typical development session memory usage:
ROS 2 Master Node:     2GB
Gazebo Simulator:      4GB
RViz (Visualization):  3GB
Isaac Sim:             8GB
VS Code + Extensions:  2GB
Docker Containers:     3GB
Chrome (Documentation):2GB
----------------------------
Total:                24GB
```

**Minimum:** 16GB (usable but tight)
**Recommended:** 32GB (comfortable)
**Enthusiast:** 64GB (overkill for most)

#### DDR4 vs DDR5?

| Type | Speed | Price Premium | Recommendation |
|------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| DDR4 | 3200-3600 MHz | Baseline | ✅ Sufficient for most users |
| DDR5 | 5200-6000 MHz | +30% | Optional; minimal performance gain |

**Verdict:** DDR4 is fine. Save money for better GPU/CPU.

---

### 💿 **Storage: Fast I/O Matters**

#### Why NVMe SSD?

Robotics simulations load **gigabytes of assets**:
- Isaac Sim environments: 500MB - 5GB per scene
- Docker images (ROS 2 + dependencies): 10GB+
- Simulation logs (rosbags): 1GB per hour

**NVMe SSD vs SATA SSD:**

| Metric | SATA SSD | NVMe SSD |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Read Speed | 550 MB/s | 3,500 MB/s |
| Scene Load Time | 15 seconds | 3 seconds |
| Docker Image Pull | 60 seconds | 12 seconds |

**Minimum:** 256GB NVMe SSD
**Recommended:** 500GB NVMe SSD
**Data Hoarders:** 1TB NVMe + 2TB HDD for datasets

:::tip Installation Strategy
1. **NVMe SSD:** Operating system, ROS 2, Isaac Sim
2. **HDD/Secondary SSD:** Datasets, rosbag logs, Docker volumes
:::

---

### 💻 **Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (The Only Choice)**

#### Why Ubuntu?

**ROS 2 Humble** (the version we use) officially targets **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**:
- Pre-built binary packages available via `apt install`
- Maximum compatibility with robotics libraries
- 10+ years of community support and tutorials

#### Why Not Windows or macOS?

| OS | ROS 2 Support | Isaac Sim Support | Verdict |
|----|--------------|--------------------|---------|
| **Ubuntu 22.04** | ✅ Native, full support | ✅ Native, best performance | ⭐ **Recommended** |
| **Windows 11** | ⚠️ WSL2 only, limited | ⚠️ Runs, but slower | Avoid for production |
| **macOS** | ❌ Not supported | ❌ Not supported | ❌ **Incompatible** |

:::danger macOS Incompatibility
Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs **cannot run ROS 2 or Isaac Sim natively**. Even with virtualization (UTM, Parallels), GPU passthrough is not supported. **You need a PC with an NVIDIA GPU.**
:::

#### Dual Boot vs WSL2 vs Native

**Option 1: Native Ubuntu (Recommended)**
- ✅ Full hardware access, best performance
- ✅ No hypervisor overhead
- ❌ Requires dedicated partition or separate drive

**Option 2: Dual Boot (Windows + Ubuntu)**
- ✅ Keep Windows for gaming/other software
- ✅ Native Linux performance when in Ubuntu
- ⚠️ Need to reboot to switch OS

**Option 3: WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
- ✅ No reboot needed, run Linux alongside Windows
- ❌ 10-20% performance penalty
- ❌ GPU passthrough can be finicky
- ❌ Limited USB device access (important for real robots)

**Our Recommendation:** Install Ubuntu 22.04 natively or dual-boot. WSL2 is acceptable for learning, but you'll hit limitations.
