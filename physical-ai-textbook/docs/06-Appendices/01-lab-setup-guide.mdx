# Building the Physical AI Lab

## Introduction: The Infrastructure Decision

Before you write your first line of robot code, you face a critical infrastructure decision: **Cloud or Physical?** This isn't just about cost—it's about latency, scalability, maintenance, and learning objectives.

:::tip The Hybrid Approach
Most successful Physical AI programs use **both**: cloud for training compute-intensive models, physical hardware for real-time inference and robot control.
:::

---

## Option 1: The "Ether Lab" (Cloud Infrastructure)

### Why Cloud?

The cloud-based approach eliminates upfront capital expenditure (CapEx) and provides instant access to high-end GPUs without hardware maintenance.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Zero upfront investment
- ✅ Instant provisioning (spin up instances in 2 minutes)
- ✅ Access to latest hardware (H100s, A100s on demand)
- ✅ No cooling, power, or space requirements
- ✅ Perfect for 10-week courses (no equipment storage)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Ongoing operational costs (OpEx)
- ❌ Network latency for real-time control
- ❌ Cannot connect to physical robots directly
- ❌ Data egress fees (downloading models)
- ❌ Credit exhaustion risk for students

---

### Recommended Cloud Configuration

#### AWS g5.2xlarge Instance

**Specifications:**
- **GPU**: 1x NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core (24GB VRAM)
- **vCPUs**: 8 cores (3rd Gen AMD EPYC)
- **RAM**: 32 GB
- **Storage**: 225 GB NVMe SSD
- **Network**: Up to 10 Gbps
- **Cost**: ~$1.21/hour (On-Demand, us-east-1)

**Monthly Cost Estimate (8 hours/day, 20 days/month):**
```
$1.21/hour × 8 hours/day × 20 days = $193.60/month
```

:::warning Cost Management
Enable **auto-stop** after 2 hours of inactivity to prevent accidental overnight charges ($30+ per night).

## CapEx vs OpEx Analysis

### 5-Year Total Cost of Ownership

**Cloud (AWS g5.2xlarge):**
```
Cost per hour: $1.21
Hours per week: 40 (full-time usage)
Weeks per year: 50 (accounting for breaks)

Annual cost: $1.21 × 40 × 50 = $2,420/year
5-year cost: $2,420 × 5 = $12,100
```

**Physical Workstation:**
```
Initial investment: $1,849
Electricity: ~$15/month × 12 × 5 = $900
Upgrades (RAM, storage): $300 over 5 years

5-year cost: $1,849 + $900 + $300 = $3,049
```

**Break-even point**: ~18 months of regular usage

:::tip Institutional Decision
- **Universities**: Physical workstations (multi-student access, 10+ year amortization)
- **Bootcamps/Short Courses**: Cloud (no maintenance, pay-per-use)
- **Individual Learners**: Physical if committed to 2+ years, Cloud for experimentation
:::

## Recommended Lab Layout

### Small-Scale Lab (1-10 Students)

**Configuration:**
- 5x Physical Workstations (RTX 4070 Ti)
- 1x High-end Server (Dual RTX 4090s for shared training)
- 1x NAS (Network Attached Storage) for datasets
- 10Gbps local network

**Cost**: ~$15,000 initial + $200/month electricity

---

### Large-Scale Lab (50+ Students)

**Configuration:**
- 2x Physical Workstations (instructor demos)
- AWS Cloud Credits ($100/student/semester)
- Remote desktop infrastructure (Apache Guacamole)
- GitLab instance for code collaboration

**Cost**: ~$10,000 setup + $5,000/semester cloud

---

## Space and Power Requirements

### Physical Requirements

**Per Workstation:**
- **Space**: 2' × 2' desk footprint
- **Power**: 850W PSU (draws 300-600W typical)

- **Ventilation**: Avoid enclosed cabinets (GPU needs airflow)

**Classroom Setup:**
- **Electrical**: 15A circuit per 2 workstations
- **Cooling**: 1 ton AC per 5 workstations
- **Fire Safety**: Ensure proper extinguisher access

:::danger Fire Hazard
Never run more than 3 high-power GPUs on a single 15A household circuit. Use dedicated 20A circuits for labs.
:::

---

## Maintenance and Upkeep

### Physical Workstation Maintenance

**Monthly:**
- Clean dust filters (every 30 days in dusty environments)
- Check GPU temperatures (below 80°C under load)
- Backup important datasets

**Quarterly:**
- Update NVIDIA drivers
- Update Ubuntu kernel
- Repaste thermal compound if temps exceed 85°C

**Annual:**
- Replace case fans (if noisy or failing)
- Upgrade storage if under 20% free space
- Consider GPU upgrade if under 8GB VRAM

---

## Decision Framework

### Choose **Cloud** if:
- ✅ Course duration under 6 months
- ✅ Budget is flexible (OpEx model approved)
- ✅ No physical robot hardware
- ✅ Students work remotely
- ✅ Need access to H100/A100 GPUs

### Choose **Physical** if:
- ✅ Long-term commitment (2+ years)
- ✅ Budget has upfront capital available
- ✅ Physical robots in lab (Unitree, Boston Dynamics)
- ✅ Low-latency control required
- ✅ Want to teach hardware maintenance

---

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Best of Both Worlds

**Local Workstations** (1-2 units):
- Robot control and testing
- Real-time inference (Jetson connected)
- Student project demonstrations

**Cloud Instances** (AWS/GCP):
- Large-scale RL training (Isaac Gym)
- Synthetic data generation (10,000+ images)
- Model fine-tuning (LoRA, RLHF)

**Workflow:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Local Workstation] -->|Upload Model| B[Cloud GPU]
    B -->|Train 24 hours| C[Trained Weights]
    C -->|Download| A
    A -->|Deploy| D[Jetson Orin Nano]
    D -->|Control| E[Physical Robot]
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cloud Problems

**Issue**: "Insufficient capacity" error on AWS
```bash
# Solution: Try different availability zone
aws ec2 run-instances ... --availability-zone us-east-1b
```

**Issue**: Slow SSH connection
```bash
# Solution: Enable connection multiplexing
# Add to ~/.ssh/config:
Host *.compute.amazonaws.com
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
    ControlPersist 600
```

### Physical Hardware Problems

**Issue**: GPU not detected in Ubuntu
```bash
# Solution: Secure boot may block NVIDIA drivers
# Disable in BIOS or sign drivers:
sudo mokutil --disable-validation
```

**Issue**: Overheating (greater than 85°C)
```bash
# Check fan speeds
nvidia-smi -q -d TEMPERATURE

# Solution: Improve case airflow or repaste GPU
```
